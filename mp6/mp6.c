introduction
this file is a code about tetris game
The screenshot above is taken from the animated version of the game, which you can play once you have
completed and debugged your code. Until that work is done, you can use the full text mode for debugging,
in which each command must be followed by the <Enter> key, avoiding any time pressure but making for
a somewhat less enjoyable game.
In the game, pieces of various shapes appear at the top of the game board. Each piece consists of four
blocks, each represented by one ASCII character in the display. The pieces can be moved left and right,
and can be rotated clockwise and counter-clockwise. The pieces can also be moved downward.
Pieces can only move within the board, and only into empty areas. If the player attempts to move or rotate
a piece so as to make it leave the board, or so as to move the blocks in the piece over blocks left from
previous pieces (see the bottom of the board in the screenshot), the move simply fails.
If a downward move fails, the current piece is fixed in place, which is shown by the pieceâ€™s blocks changing
from asterisks ('*') to percent signs ( '%' ). Any rows filled with old blocks are then removed from the
board, and any rows above them move downward in the board (one space per row removed, so any gaps
remain).
A new piece is then added at the top of the board, and play continues.
If the board does not have space for a new piece, the game is over.

/* 
 * The maximum number of blocks in one piece.  Do not change for
 * this assignment (you can do as you like with the code afterward).
 */
#define MAX_PIECE_SIZE 4

/*
 * Pieces are defined by an array of offsets from the center point.
 * Each piece consists of a set of adjacent blocks that together form
 * the piece.  The first index of the array is the piece type, the 
 * second is the orientation (0-3), the third is block index within 
 * the piece (0 to MAX_PIECE_SIZE - 1), and the fourth gives the 
 * x (0) and y (1) offsets of the block relative to the center point.
 * Note that the first block is always the center point of the piece.
 * 
 * Offsets may be replicated if a piece contains fewer than MAX_PIECE_SIZE
 * blocks.
 *
 * Clockwise rotation changes the orientation in the positive (mod 4)
 * direction, and counter-clockwise rotation changes the orientation in
 * the negative (mod 4) direction.
